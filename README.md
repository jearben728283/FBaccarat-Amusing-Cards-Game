# FBaccarat-Amusing-Cards-Game

FBaccarat: Amusing Cards Game: Blackjack, Ace has a value of 1; poker from 2 to 9 has its face value; 10, J, Q, and K is 0. When the sum of the points of all cards exceeds 9, only the single digits in the total number are counted. Therefore, the value of 8 plus 9 is 7 (8 + 9 = 17). Because baccarat only counts one digit of poker, the maximum number of points is 9 (ie, a 4 and a 5: 4 + 5 = 9), and a minimum of 0, also known as baccarat (eg, a 10 and a Q : 10 + 10 = 20, single digit is 0).

Note: This game is for adults of legal age and for entertainment purposes only.
